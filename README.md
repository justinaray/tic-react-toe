# Tic-React-Toe

Just a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in react for my kids to play when we're out to dinner.

## Playground Version

This is just a quick version I threw together.  It uses inline Babel transpilation and CDN versions
of react.  There is no build or tooling, no minimax CPU player, and it needs responsive style,
match mode, and customizations.

I'll get to all that ... eventually :)
